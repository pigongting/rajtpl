# @huse/network

Provides hooks to resolve and listen on network states like online or connectivity.

## useOnLine

`useOnLine` returns a boolean indicates whether client is currently online.

In case where client doesn't support `online` and `offline` events, this hook always return `true`.

<Playground>
    {
        () => {
            const isOnLine = useOnLine();
            return (
                <>
                    {isOnLine ? <CheckCircleOutlined /> : <CloseCircleOutlined />}
                    You are currently
                    <strong>{isOnLine ? 'ONLINE' : 'OFFLINE'}</strong>
                </>
            )
        }
    }
